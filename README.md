# ExplodeYourFriends
This is a simple PocketMine plugin which allows you to explode your friends.

Use "/explode [player] [force]" to explode a given player!

##Current Features:

Use the command /explode as an op to blow up given players.

NEW!: Use "/explode [player] [force]" to change the force of the explosion. Force is a number between 1-20.

Trust me you'd need a really good server to go over 20!

##Planned Features:

Option to toggle the command on and off.

##Known Bugs:

Explosions cause harm to other players near the target.
